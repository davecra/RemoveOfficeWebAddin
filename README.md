# The "Remove Office WebAddin from Outlook" Add-in
This is a Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) Add-in that removes a Web Add-in's Customization from the Outlook for Windows Ribbon.

This is useful for when you have created a Web Add-in but it is not as feature rich as your COM add-in. So on the Windows clients, you still want your COM (or VSTO) solution to run there and not the web version of the add-in.


**NOTE:** If you are following the latest updates the the OfficeJS APIâ€™s, you will see that PowerPoint, Excel and Word have this new feature that allows you to specify an equivalent COM add-in in place of the Web Add-in.

## Configuration
Configuring and setting up this add-in is documented in the following Blog post:
